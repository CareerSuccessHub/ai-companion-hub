## 🚨 Why This Works Better Than Freemium

### Freemium Problems:
- ❌ "Why pay $5/mo for Gemini when Gemini is free?"
- ❌ Users will copy prompts to ChatGPT
- ❌ No unique value vs free alternatives
- ❌ Need 100+ paying users to hit $500/mo
- ❌ Customer support overhead

### Affiliate Advantages:
- ✅ No quota limits (everything free = aggressive caching works)
- ✅ Users get value without paying (resume templates, advice)
- ✅ Natural upsell ("Want a pro template? Here's 60% off")
- ✅ Multiple revenue streams (not just one subscription tier)
- ✅ Scales with traffic (not with conversion rate)
- ✅ No customer support for payments/cancellations

**Bottom Line:** 1,000 free users clicking affiliate links > 20 paying subscribers
