## Step 2: Add to Your Site

Once you have your GA4 Measurement ID, I'll add the tracking code to your site.

**Just share your Measurement ID and I'll integrate it!**

## What You'll Track:

✅ **Visitors:** Daily/monthly active users  
✅ **Page views:** Which pages are popular  
✅ **User flow:** How users navigate your site  
✅ **Conversions:** Affiliate link clicks, Ko-fi visits  
✅ **Demographics:** Age, location, device type  
✅ **Engagement:** Time on site, bounce rate

---

## Revenue Tracking Events (I'll set up):

- `ko_fi_click` - Donation button clicks
- `affiliate_click` - Fiverr/Skillshare link clicks
- `side_hustle_generate` - Feature usage
- `chat_message` - AI mentor interactions

---

## Why This Matters:

**Without analytics, you're flying blind.**

With GA4, you'll know:
- Which features drive engagement (build more of those)
- Where traffic comes from (double down on working channels)
- When to apply for AdSense (traffic requirements met)
- Conversion rates (optimize affiliate link placement)
