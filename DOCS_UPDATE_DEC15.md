## 🚨 Key Decisions Needed

### 1. Custom Domain (URGENT)

**Question:** Buy domain now OR wait for traffic validation?

**Option A: Buy Now ($4 per team member = $12 total)**
- **Pros:** Unlock AdSense, professional image, domain aging starts, low risk
- **Cons:** $12 upfront cost (if project fails, money lost)
- **Timeline:** Revenue possible by late Jan/Feb 2026

**Option B: Wait for Validation (500-1K organic users)**
- **Pros:** Prove market fit first, zero financial risk
- **Cons:** Delays revenue by 6-8 weeks, missed monetization opportunity
- **Timeline:** Revenue possible by Mar/Apr 2026

**Recommendation:** Buy now (see DOMAIN_DECISION.md for full analysis)

### 2. NameCheap Domain Question

**Question:** Domain + Hosting combo OR domain-only?

**Answer:** **Buy DOMAIN-ONLY ($12-13/year)**

**Reasoning:**
- ✅ Vercel hosting is FREE (unlimited bandwidth, auto-deploy)
- ✅ Custom domain on Vercel is FREE (just point DNS)
- ❌ NameCheap hosting costs $30-50/year (unnecessary)
- ❌ Switching hosting = rebuild deployment pipeline (wasted time)

**What to buy:**
- Domain registration: aicareersuccesshub.com ($12.98/year NameCheap)
- Domain privacy protection: FREE with NameCheap (normally $8.88/year)
- **Skip:** Hosting package, premium DNS, email hosting

**How it works:**
1. Buy domain from NameCheap (domain-only, no hosting)
2. Go to Vercel dashboard → Add custom domain
3. Vercel gives you DNS records
4. Add DNS records to NameCheap Advanced DNS
5. Wait 5-30 minutes for DNS propagation
6. Done! Site accessible via custom domain

**Cost:**
- Domain: $12.98/year (NameCheap)
- Vercel hosting: $0/month (free tier)
- SSL certificate: $0 (Vercel includes free HTTPS)
- **Total: $12.98/year** (split 3 ways = $4.33 each)

### 3. Marketing Launch Timeline

**Question:** Start marketing activities NOW or wait?

**Current Plan (NOT STARTED):**
- Reddit posts 3x/week
- LinkedIn content daily
- Quora answers 5x/week
- Facebook group engagement

**Options:**
1. **Start NOW (Dec 15-20):** Push for 500-1K users by Dec 31
2. **Start Jan 2026:** After holidays, fresh momentum
3. **Wait for validation:** See if organic traffic reaches 500+ first

**Consideration:** 
- Current 33 users in 6 days = ~165 users/month organic (without marketing)
- If marketing starts, could hit 500-1K users by Dec 31
- If marketing delayed, likely ~100-200 users by Dec 31

## ✅ What's Working Well

1. **Automated blog system:** 3-4 posts/week running smoothly (8 posts published)
2. **Scholarship database:** 20 active with 2026 deadlines, real-time deadline tracking
3. **UX improvements:** Blog pagination, search, filters, custom scrollbars implemented
4. **Organic traffic:** 33 users WITHOUT marketing (validates product-market fit)
5. **Team QA:** All 3 members testing features before deployment (quality control)
6. **Vercel deployment:** Auto-deploy from GitHub working perfectly (zero downtime)
