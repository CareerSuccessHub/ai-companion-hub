## 🎯 PLATFORM-SPECIFIC TACTICS

### Reddit Marketing (High Priority - 30% of traffic potential)

**Best Subreddits:**
1. **r/college** (1.3M members) - Students, resume help, career advice
2. **r/careerguidance** (450K members) - Career questions, job search
3. **r/resumes** (250K members) - Resume reviews, job applications
4. **r/students** (240K members) - General student life, scholarships
5. **r/sidehustle** (1M members) - Side income ideas
6. **r/scholarships** (180K members) - Scholarship opportunities
7. **r/jobs** (400K members) - Job search, salary negotiation
8. **r/personalfinance** (17M members) - Student loans, budgeting

**Post Types That Work:**
1. **"I built this" posts:**
   - "I'm a student who built a free AI resume reviewer because I needed it"
   - Include screenshot of tool working
   - Post link in comments (not title - less spammy)
   - Be authentic: share your story, why you built it, how it helps

2. **Value-first posts:**
   - "I analyzed 50 student resumes with AI. Here are the 5 mistakes EVERY student makes"
   - Share insights, then mention "I made a tool to fix this" in comments

3. **Resource sharing:**
   - "Found $200K in scholarships for students. Here's the database I wish I had freshman year"
   - Focus on value, tool is secondary

**Reddit Rules (Critical):**
- ❌ NEVER spam link in title
- ❌ NEVER post same content in multiple subs same day
- ✅ Provide value FIRST, tool link SECOND
- ✅ Engage with comments (respond within 1 hour)
- ✅ Be authentic (use your real story as student/developer)
- ✅ Upvote early comments (builds momentum)

**Best Times to Post (EST):**
- Tuesday-Thursday: 8-10 AM (breakfast), 2-4 PM (afternoon break)
- Avoid: Late night, Friday evening, Monday morning

**Template - "I Built This" Post:**
```
Title: I built a free AI resume reviewer for students (no signup required)

Body:
Hey r/college! I'm a student who struggled with resume writing last year. 
Applied to 50+ jobs, got 2 interviews. Then I used AI to rewrite my resume 
and landed 12 interviews in the next month.

So I built a free tool that does what worked for me:
- AI analyzes your resume in 30 seconds
- Gives specific feedback (not generic advice)
- No signup, no payment, 100% free
- Works on mobile too

I'm not trying to sell anything - just wanted to share what helped me. 
[link in comments if anyone wants to try it]

Happy to answer questions about resume tips or the tool!
```

**Template - Value Post:**
```
Title: 5 resume mistakes that cost me 40+ job rejections (and how to fix them)

Body:
I analyzed my own resume and 50+ other student resumes using AI. 
Here are the mistakes 80%+ of students make:

1. Generic objective statements ("seeking challenging opportunity")
   → Fix: Specific value statement ("Reduced customer complaints 40%")

2. No metrics (just "improved team performance")
   → Fix: "Led team of 5, increased project delivery speed by 25%"

3. Too long (2-3 pages for entry-level)
   → Fix: 1 page max, every word counts

4. Skills section at bottom (recruiters miss it)
   → Fix: Put technical skills near top

5. Typos and formatting errors
   → Fix: Use AI to catch mistakes you miss

I built a free AI tool that checks for these (and 20+ other issues). 
No signup required. [link in comments]

## ✅ DO'S AND DON'TS

### DO:
✅ Provide value FIRST, promote tools SECOND  
✅ Use your real story (student, developer, struggled with X)  
✅ Respond to comments within 1-2 hours  
✅ Track what works (double down on winners)  
✅ Be patient (Reddit posts take 2-4 hours to gain traction)  
✅ Use screenshots/visuals (tools in action)  
✅ Test different post types (stories, tips, case studies)  
✅ Engage more than you post (80/20 rule)  
✅ Follow platform rules (read subreddit rules, group rules)  
✅ Be authentic (people can smell fake)  

### DON'T:
❌ Spam links everywhere (instant ban)  
❌ Post same content across 10 subreddits same day  
❌ Ignore comments (kills engagement)  
❌ Use clickbait titles (loses trust)  
❌ Focus on likes/upvotes (focus on clicks/visitors)  
❌ Give up after 1 week (takes 2-3 weeks to see results)  
❌ Argue with negative comments (respond politely or ignore)  
❌ Post only about your tools (share other resources too)  
❌ Forget to track metrics (need data to improve)  
❌ Burn out (marketing is marathon, not sprint)

## 🎯 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "My Reddit posts get 0 upvotes"
**Reasons:**
- Posted in wrong subreddit (not relevant)
- Posted at wrong time (late night, Monday morning)
- Title is too salesy ("Try my tool!")
- No value in body (just a link)

**Fix:**
- Research subreddit (read top posts, what works?)
- Post Tue-Thu 8-10 AM or 2-4 PM EST
- Rewrite title (focus on value: "5 resume mistakes...")
- Provide value first (tips, story), link second

---

### "LinkedIn posts get 50 impressions, no clicks"
**Reasons:**
- Hook is weak (first line doesn't grab attention)
- No visual (text-only posts get lower reach)
- Posted at wrong time (low engagement hours)
- No engagement in comments (LinkedIn algorithm punishes this)

**Fix:**
- Test 5 different hooks (surprising stat, question, bold statement)
- Add screenshot of tool working
- Post 8-10 AM or 12-1 PM Philippine Time
- Reply to every comment within 1 hour (boosts algorithm)

---

### "Quora answers get views but no clicks"
**Reasons:**
- Answer is too short (Quora favors 300+ word answers)
- Link is too early (looks spammy)
- No personal story (generic advice)

**Fix:**
- Write 400-500 words minimum
- Link in last paragraph (after providing value)
- Start with "I struggled with this..." (builds connection)

---

### "Getting traffic but no tool usage"
**Reasons:**
- Landing on blog/homepage (not tool page)
- Tool isn't clear (what does it do?)
- Tool looks complicated (too many fields)

**Fix:**
- Link directly to tool page (not homepage)
- Add 1-sentence explainer above tool ("Paste resume, get AI feedback in 30 sec")
- Simplify UI (remove optional fields, focus on core value)
