# Marketing Execution Guide - 14-DAY SPRINT TEST

**Last Updated:** January 4, 2026  
**Owner:** Marketing Specialist  
**Current Reality:** 170 lifetime users (since Dec 9), 30-70/week, $0 budget, ZERO marketing done  
**Goal:** Test if FREE marketing can generate 100+ new visitors in 14 days  
**Timeline:** Jan 5-18, 2026 (DECISION POINT on Jan 18)

---

## 🚨 REALITY CHECK - Why We're Here

**What Was Supposed to Happen (Dec 2025 Plan):**
- Marketing specialist posts daily on Reddit, LinkedIn, Quora, Facebook
- Reach 500-1,000 monthly visitors by Dec 31
- Generate affiliate link clicks, Ko-fi donations
- Build audience for monetization

**What Actually Happened (Jan 4, 2026):**
- ❌ ZERO marketing posts made (no Reddit, no LinkedIn, no Quora, no Facebook)
- ❌ 170 lifetime users in 4 weeks = 100% organic traffic
- ❌ All affiliates rejected (PartnerStack, Coursera) or soft-rejected (26 days pending)
- ❌ $0 revenue (AdSense pending, Ko-fi $0)
- ❌ Goal of 500-1,000 monthly visitors missed (have 120-280/month)

**Why the Elaborate Weekly Schedule Failed:**
- Too complex (7 platforms × daily tasks = overwhelm)
- No accountability (tasks unchecked for weeks)
- No quick feedback loop (can't tell what works after 1 week)
- No decision criteria (when to stop if not working?)

**New Approach: 14-Day Focused Sprint**
- Test ONE marketing hypothesis per week
- Track results DAILY (not weekly)
- Make GO/NO-GO decision on Jan 18
- Simple, measurable, time-boxed

---

## 📅 14-DAY SPRINT PLAN

### Week 1 (Jan 5-11): Reddit Focus
**Hypothesis:** Authentic \"I built this\" posts in r/college drive traffic

**Daily Actions:**
- **Jan 5 (Sun):** Research top posts in r/college, r/resumes, r/scholarships. Find post format that works.
- **Jan 6 (Mon):** Write Reddit post #1 for r/college. Post 2-4 PM EST. Engage in comments for 2 hours.
- **Jan 7 (Tue):** Check post #1 results. If >10 upvotes, post #2 in r/resumes. If <10, revise approach.
- **Jan 8 (Wed):** Post #3 in r/scholarships (scholarship database angle). Engage in comments.
- **Jan 9 (Thu):** Review Week 1 results. Count clicks from Reddit (GA4).
- **Jan 10 (Fri):** If Reddit working (50+ clicks), post #4-5 in more subreddits. If not working (<20 clicks), STOP Reddit.
- **Jan 11 (Sat):** Measure: Total new visitors from Reddit. Did Reddit drive >50 new visitors? (YES/NO)

**Success Metric:** 50+ new visitors from Reddit in 7 days  
**Tracking:** GA4 → Acquisition → Traffic acquisition → reddit.com referrals

**Reddit Post Template (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
Title: I built a free AI resume reviewer for students (no signup, actually free)

Body:
Hey r/college! I'm a student who needed resume help but career center wait times were 2+ weeks. So I built a free AI tool that reviews resumes in 30 seconds.

Features:
- Paste your resume → get specific feedback in 30s
- Checks for ATS compatibility, formatting, content issues
- 100% free, no signup, no credit card
- Your resume isn't stored (privacy first)

I'm not selling anything - just sharing what helped me. Used it to improve my resume and landed 3 interviews last month.

### Week 2 (Jan 12-18): LinkedIn Focus (IF Reddit Failed) OR Double Down on Reddit (IF Reddit Worked)

**Scenario A: If Reddit got >50 visitors**
- Jan 12-18: Post 5-10 more times in different subreddits
- Expand to: r/jobs, r/careerguidance, r/sidehustle, r/personalfinance
- Refine messaging based on Week 1 learnings
- **Goal:** 100+ new visitors from Reddit in Week 2

**Scenario B: If Reddit got <50 visitors**
- Switch to LinkedIn (test different audience)
- Jan 12-18: Post 1 LinkedIn post daily (7 total)
- Focus: Career tips + tool mentions
- **Goal:** 50+ new visitors from LinkedIn

**Decision Point (Jan 18, 2026):**
After 14 days, evaluate:

| Metric | Target | Action |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Total new visitors | 100+ | ✅ Marketing WORKS - continue with Month 2 plan |
| Total new visitors | 50-100 | ⚠️ Marketing SLOW - refine messaging, try 2 more weeks |
| Total new visitors | <50 | 🛑 Marketing FAILED - pivot to SEO content only OR parallel project |

---

## ✅ IF SPRINT SUCCEEDS (100+ visitors in 14 days)

### Month 2 Plan (Jan 19 - Feb 15):
**Goal:** Scale to 500 monthly visitors

**What to do:**
1. Double down on what worked (Reddit OR LinkedIn)
2. Post frequency: 3-5x/week on winning channel
3. Add 2nd channel: If Reddit worked, add LinkedIn. If LinkedIn worked, add Quora.
4. Write 5-10 SEO blog posts (capture organic search traffic)
5. Track: Are visitors returning? (check GA4 returning users %)

**Expected outcome:** 300-500 monthly visitors by end of February

---

## 🛑 IF SPRINT FAILS (<50 visitors in 14 days)

### Pivot Options:

**Option A: Pure SEO Content Strategy**
- STOP all social media marketing (not working)
- Write 30-50 SEO blog posts targeting long-tail keywords
- Focus: \"college resume with no experience\" (5K searches/mo)
- Timeline: 3-6 months for Google ranking
- Expected: 100-300 organic visitors/month by Jun 2026

**Option B: Pause Project, Start Parallel**
- This project: Run blog automation passively (3-4 posts/week, no manual work)
- New project: Simpler model (pure content site, digital products, or service)
- Check in monthly: If this grows organically, come back
- If stays flat after 3 months, let it die gracefully

**Option C: Hard Pivot to Paid Service**
- Stop \"free AI tools\" model
- Offer: Personal resume review service ($20-50 per resume)
- Use AI backend + human editing
- Sell on: Fiverr, Upwork, directly via site
- Immediate revenue, no traffic needed

## 🎯 WHY 14-DAY SPRINT vs WEEKLY SCHEDULE?

**Old Plan Problems:**
- ❌ Too many platforms (Reddit, LinkedIn, Facebook, Quora, Twitter = overwhelm)
- ❌ No accountability (7 days × 3 posts = 21 tasks, none completed)
- ❌ Can't measure what works (posting everywhere = can't tell which channel drives traffic)
- ❌ No decision criteria (when do you stop if it's not working?)

**New Sprint Advantages:**
- ✅ One platform at a time (Week 1 = Reddit only, Week 2 = double down OR pivot)
- ✅ Daily tracking (see results within 24 hours, adjust quickly)
- ✅ Clear success metrics (100+ visitors in 14 days OR stop)
- ✅ Time-boxed (14 days = not months of wasted effort)
- ✅ Actionable decision (Jan 18 = stay or pivot, no ambiguity)

## 💡 LESSONS LEARNED (Updated Jan 2026)

**What Didn't Work:**
1. ❌ Waiting for affiliate approvals (all rejected at low traffic)
2. ❌ Complex marketing plans (7 platforms × daily tasks = overwhelm)
3. ❌ Building tools before traffic (4 tools, 30-70 visitors/week total)
4. ❌ Assuming \"if we build it, they will come\" (they don't)

**What Might Work:**
1. ✅ 14-day focused sprints (test one hypothesis at a time)
2. ✅ SEO content (30-50 blog posts = organic traffic in 3-6 months)
3. ✅ Authentic storytelling (\"I built this as a student\" vs \"Check out this tool\")
4. ✅ Decision criteria (know when to pivot vs keep going)

Title: I built a free AI resume reviewer for students (no signup required)

Body:
Hey r/college! I'm a student who struggled with resume writing last year. 
Applied to 50+ jobs, got 2 interviews. Then I used AI to rewrite my resume 
and landed 12 interviews in the next month.

So I built a free tool that does what worked for me:
- AI analyzes your resume in 30 seconds
- Gives specific feedback (not generic advice)
- No signup, no payment, 100% free
- Works on mobile too

I'm not trying to sell anything - just wanted to share what helped me.

Happy to answer questions about resume tips or the tool!

**Template - Value Post:**
```
Title: 5 resume mistakes that cost me 40+ job rejections (and how to fix them)

Body:
I analyzed my own resume and 50+ other student resumes using AI. 
Here are the mistakes 80%+ of students make:

1. Generic objective statements ("seeking challenging opportunity")
   → Fix: Specific value statement ("Reduced customer complaints 40%")

2. No metrics (just "improved team performance")
   → Fix: "Led team of 5, increased project delivery speed by 25%"

3. Too long (2-3 pages for entry-level)
   → Fix: 1 page max, every word counts

4. Skills section at bottom (recruiters miss it)
   → Fix: Put technical skills near top

5. Typos and formatting errors
   → Fix: Use AI to catch mistakes you miss

I built a free AI tool that checks for these (and 20+ other issues). 
No signup required. [link in comments]

## ✅ DO'S AND DON'TS

### DO:
✅ Provide value FIRST, promote tools SECOND  
✅ Use your real story (student, developer, struggled with X)  
✅ Respond to comments within 1-2 hours  
✅ Track what works (double down on winners)  
✅ Be patient (Reddit posts take 2-4 hours to gain traction)  
✅ Use screenshots/visuals (tools in action)  
✅ Test different post types (stories, tips, case studies)  
✅ Engage more than you post (80/20 rule)  
✅ Follow platform rules (read subreddit rules, group rules)  
✅ Be authentic (people can smell fake)  

### DON'T:
❌ Spam links everywhere (instant ban)  
❌ Post same content across 10 subreddits same day  
❌ Ignore comments (kills engagement)  
❌ Use clickbait titles (loses trust)  
❌ Focus on likes/upvotes (focus on clicks/visitors)  
❌ Give up after 1 week (takes 2-3 weeks to see results)  
❌ Argue with negative comments (respond politely or ignore)  
❌ Post only about your tools (share other resources too)  
❌ Forget to track metrics (need data to improve)  
❌ Burn out (marketing is marathon, not sprint)

## 🎯 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "My Reddit posts get 0 upvotes"
**Reasons:**
- Posted in wrong subreddit (not relevant)
- Posted at wrong time (late night, Monday morning)
- Title is too salesy ("Try my tool!")
- No value in body (just a link)

**Fix:**
- Research subreddit (read top posts, what works?)
- Post Tue-Thu 8-10 AM or 2-4 PM EST
- Rewrite title (focus on value: "5 resume mistakes...")
- Provide value first (tips, story), link second

---

### "LinkedIn posts get 50 impressions, no clicks"
**Reasons:**
- Hook is weak (first line doesn't grab attention)
- No visual (text-only posts get lower reach)
- Posted at wrong time (low engagement hours)
- No engagement in comments (LinkedIn algorithm punishes this)

**Fix:**
- Test 5 different hooks (surprising stat, question, bold statement)
- Add screenshot of tool working
- Post 8-10 AM or 12-1 PM Philippine Time
- Reply to every comment within 1 hour (boosts algorithm)

---

### "Quora answers get views but no clicks"
**Reasons:**
- Answer is too short (Quora favors 300+ word answers)
- Link is too early (looks spammy)
- No personal story (generic advice)

**Fix:**
- Write 400-500 words minimum
- Link in last paragraph (after providing value)
- Start with "I struggled with this..." (builds connection)

---

### "Getting traffic but no tool usage"
**Reasons:**
- Landing on blog/homepage (not tool page)
- Tool isn't clear (what does it do?)
- Tool looks complicated (too many fields)

**Fix:**
- Link directly to tool page (not homepage)
- Add 1-sentence explainer above tool ("Paste resume, get AI feedback in 30 sec")
- Simplify UI (remove optional fields, focus on core value)
