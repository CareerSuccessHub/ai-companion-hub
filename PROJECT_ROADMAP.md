## 🚨 Risk Management

### Technical Risks:
- **Gemini API Limit:** gemini-2.5-flash (500/day) + fallbacks (2000/day combined) = 2500 total capacity
  - Resets midnight PT (4 PM Philippine Time)
  - **Mitigation:** 3-tier fallback system, cache responses, rate limiting
  - **Capacity:** Can handle 1,000+ daily visitors (10-20% use AI = 100-200 requests)
- **Vercel Build Time:** Free tier = 100 hours/month
  - **Mitigation:** Optimize build process, use ISR for blog posts
- **Database:** Currently using static JSON files
  - **Mitigation:** Scale to Vercel KV or Supabase when >10K visitors

### Business Risks:
- **Seasonal Traffic:** Students leave in summer (June-Aug = -40% traffic)
  - **Mitigation:** Expand to young professionals (Phase 7)
- **Affiliate Delays:** Fiverr/Skillshare still pending approval
  - **Mitigation:** Add more affiliate programs (Coursera, Udemy, Amazon)
- **Single Revenue Stream:** Currently only Ko-fi donations
  - **Mitigation:** Prioritize AdSense application (need 500 visitors)

### Competition Risks:
- **AI Resume Tools:** VMock, Rezi, Jobscan (paid competitors)
  - **Advantage:** We're free + multi-tool platform
- **Career Advice Blogs:** Indeed, Glassdoor, The Muse
  - **Advantage:** AI-powered tools, not just articles
