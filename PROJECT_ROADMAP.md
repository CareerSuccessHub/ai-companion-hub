## 🚨 Risk Management

### Technical Risks:
- **Gemini API Limit:** 1,500 requests/day resets midnight PT (4 PM Philippine Time)
  - **Mitigation:** Cache responses, implement rate limiting
- **Vercel Build Time:** Free tier = 100 hours/month
  - **Mitigation:** Optimize build process, use ISR for blog posts

  - **Mitigation:** Scale to Vercel KV or Supabase when >10K visitors

### Business Risks:
- **Seasonal Traffic:** Students leave in summer (June-Aug = -40% traffic)

### Competition Risks:
- **AI Resume Tools:** VMock, Rezi, Jobscan (paid competitors)
  - **Advantage:** We're free + multi-tool platform
- **Career Advice Blogs:** Indeed, Glassdoor, The Muse
  - **Advantage:** AI-powered tools, not just articles
