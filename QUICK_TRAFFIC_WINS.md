# Quick Traffic Wins - START TODAY

## 🎯 Priority 1: LinkedIn Post (Do RIGHT NOW - 10 minutes)

### Copy-Paste Template:
```
I just launched a free AI tool that writes salary negotiation scripts in 30 seconds.

After watching too many friends accept lowball offers, I built this to help people ask for what they're worth.

Here's what it does:
• Analyzes your job offer vs. market rates
• Generates a personalized negotiation script
• Suggests specific $ amounts to ask for
• 100% free, no signup required

I also wrote a guide on how I used this exact approach to negotiate $15K more on my last offer.

Try it: ai-companion-hub-self.vercel.app

(Would love feedback - it's brand new!)

#CareerAdvice #SalaryNegotiation #JobSearch #CareerGrowth
```

**Post this on:**
- LinkedIn (main profile)
- LinkedIn groups you're in (career, tech, etc.)
- Twitter/X (if you have account)

**Expected result:** 20-50 clicks in first 24 hours

## 🎯 Priority 2: Email 10 People (20 minutes)

### Who to Email:
- Friends who recently got job offers
- College classmates job hunting
- Former coworkers who switched jobs
- Anyone who mentioned salary/job search recently

### Email Template:
```
Subject: Built this free tool - thought you might find it useful

Hey [Name],

Hope you're doing well! I know you mentioned [job searching / getting an offer / career stuff] recently, so I wanted to share something I just built.

It's a free AI tool that generates salary negotiation scripts. You put in the job title and offer amount, and it creates a personalized script with specific dollar amounts to ask for.

No signup required, totally free: ai-companion-hub-self.vercel.app

There's also a resume reviewer and career mentor chatbot if those are useful.

Would love to know what you think!
