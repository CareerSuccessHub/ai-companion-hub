# Traffic Generation Strategy - AI Student Success Hub
**Goal:** 500-1,000 visitors in first 2-3 weeks for AdSense eligibility

## 🎯 FREE Traffic Sources (1 hour/day commitment)

### 1. Reddit Marketing (High Priority)
**Subreddits to target:**
- r/college (1.3M members) - Post: "I built a free AI resume reviewer for students"
- r/students (240K members) - Share scholarship finder
- r/careerguidance (450K members) - Share AI mentor for career advice
- r/sidehustle (1M members) - Share side hustle generator + blog post
- r/scholarships (180K members) - Share scholarship database
- r/personalfinance (17M members) - Share student financial tools

**Reddit Strategy:**
- Provide VALUE first, not spam
- Post template: "Hey r/college! I'm a student who built [TOOL] because I needed it. It's 100% free. Here's what it does..."
- Use throwaway account OR authentic student story
- Respond to comments quickly
- Post best times: Tuesday-Thursday 8-10am EST
- AVOID: Direct links in titles, self-promotion language
- DO: Screenshot of tool working + "link in comments"

**Expected traffic:** 200-500 visitors/week if 2-3 posts get traction

---

### 2. Twitter/X Growth (Medium Priority)
**Content strategy:**
- Tweet 3x/day: Student tips + tool screenshots
- Hashtags: #StudentLife #CollegeTips #Scholarships #CareerAdvice #SideHustle
- Engage with student influencers (like/comment/quote tweet)
- Share blog content as threads

**Sample tweets:**
1. "Just analyzed 50 student resumes with AI. Here are the 5 mistakes EVERY student makes 🧵"
2. "Found $200K in scholarships for students. Here's the database I wish I had freshman year 💰"
