**Reddit Strategy:**
- Provide VALUE first, not spam
- Post template: "Hey r/college! I'm a student who built [TOOL] because I needed it. It's 100% free. Here's what it does..."
- Use throwaway account OR authentic student story
- Respond to comments quickly
- Post best times: Tuesday-Thursday 8-10am EST
- AVOID: Direct links in titles, self-promotion language
- DO: Screenshot of tool working + "link in comments"

**Expected traffic:** 200-500 visitors/week if 2-3 posts get traction

---

### 2. Twitter/X Growth (Medium Priority)

**Target servers:**
- College-specific Discords (search for your university)

---

### 4. Quora Answers (Long-term SEO)
**Target questions:**
- "Best side hustles for college students?"
- "How to find scholarships?"

- "AI career advice for students?"

**Strategy:**

- Be genuinely helpful

**Expected traffic:** 30-80 visitors/week

### If Week 2 < 150 Visitors:
**Escalation:**
- Marketing: Launch TikTok campaign immediately (don't wait for Week 2)
