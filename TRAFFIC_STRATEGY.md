**Reddit Strategy:**
- Provide VALUE first, not spam
- Post template: "Hey r/college! I'm a student who built [TOOL] because I needed it. It's 100% free. Here's what it does..."
- Use throwaway account OR authentic student story
- Respond to comments quickly
- Post best times: Tuesday-Thursday 8-10am EST
- AVOID: Direct links in titles, self-promotion language
- DO: Screenshot of tool working + "link in comments"

**Expected traffic:** 200-500 visitors/week if 2-3 posts get traction

---

### 2. Twitter/X Growth (Medium Priority)
**Content strategy:**
- Tweet 3x/day: Student tips + tool screenshots
- Hashtags: #StudentLife #CollegeTips #Scholarships #CareerAdvice #SideHustle
- Engage with student influencers (like/comment/quote tweet)
- Share blog content as threads

**Sample tweets:**
1. "Just analyzed 50 student resumes with AI. Here are the 5 mistakes EVERY student makes 🧵"
2. "Found $200K in scholarships for students. Here's the database I wish I had freshman year 💰"
3. "5 side hustles making students $500-3000/month (verified by our AI tool) 🚀"

---

### 3. Student Discord Servers (Quick Wins)
**Target servers:**
- College-specific Discords (search for your university)

---

### 4. Quora Answers (Long-term SEO)
**Target questions:**
- "Best side hustles for college students?"
- "How to find scholarships?"

**Expected traffic:** 10-30 visitors/week, grows over time

---

**Content ideas:**

- Share scholarship deadlines: "Hey guys, Coca-Cola Scholars deadline is Oct 31 - $20K! Here's the link..."
- Mention your database in comments
- Be genuinely helpful

**Expected traffic:** 30-80 visitors/week

---

### 7. Product Hunt Launch (One-time Boost)
**Timeline:** Week 2-3 after traffic validation

**Strategy:**
- Launch as "AI Student Success Hub - Free tools for students"
