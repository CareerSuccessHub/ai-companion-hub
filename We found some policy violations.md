Next: Google Publisher Restrictions
We are in the process of migrating and consolidating all of the Google Publisher Policies and Google Publisher Restrictions to the new Publisher Policies Help Center. For now, you can still view all the policies in the AdMob, AdSense, and Ad Manager Help Centers, as well as the new Help Center. 
When you monetize your content with Google ad code you are required to adhere to the following policies. Failure to comply with these policies may result in Google blocking ads from appearing against your content, or suspending or terminating your account.

These policies apply in addition to any other policies governing your use of Google publisher products.

Google helps to enable a free and open internet by helping publishers monetize their content and advertisers reach prospective customers with useful, relevant products and services. Maintaining trust in the ads ecosystem requires setting limits on what we will monetize.

Google Publisher Policies are organized into the following categories:

Manage your sites
Google AdSense content and user experience
Next: Remove a site from your AdSense sites list
To monetize a site with AdSense, you should have unique and valuable content and provide a good user experience. Explore our tips here.

Provide enough unique content
For your site to be ready to show AdSense ads, make sure that your pages have enough unique content so that we can determine what your site is about. You should provide content that gives your users a reason to visit and return to your site.



For subtitles in your language, turn on YouTube captions. Select the settings icon Image of YouTube settings icon at the bottom of the video player, then select "Subtitles/CC" and choose your language.

 

When you create content, it’s important to ask yourself if it provides substantial value and originality when compared to other sites covering similar subjects, as this will attract more visitors to your site. Tools such as Google Trends can give you a feel for what people are interested in so you can tailor your content. Google Analytics includes many free-of-charge tools that can help you to build a more complete picture of your users and identify areas where you could improve your content marketing. For more information, visit our AdSense blog post on creating outstanding website content in 3 steps.

Additionally, make sure that you update your site regularly. Continually adding new and unique content will keep your site fresh and generate more returning visitors.

Also, don't forget to make sure that your content adheres to the Spam policies for Google web search. The Spam policies for Google web search recommend that you do not use cloaking and doorway pages, pages with little to no content, or pages optimized for specific keywords or phrases.

Make certain that there’s no duplicate content
As stated in the Google Publisher Policies, Google ads may not be placed on sites with scraped or copyrighted content. Some examples of scraping sites include:

Sites that copy and republish content from other sites without adding any original content or value
Sites that copy content from other sites, modify it slightly (for example, by substituting synonyms or using automated techniques), and republish it
Sites dedicated to embedding content such as video, images, or other media from other sites without substantial added value to the user
Be careful when using external resources such as external articles or embedded videos. It's important that you contribute your own original content, whether it's specialist knowledge, improvement ideas, reviews, or your personal thoughts. Check that the content on your site is unique and that fragments are not copied from other sites. Also ensure that the same content is not duplicated in the same page or across multiple pages of your site.

If you have many pages that are similar or have very similar content, consider expanding each page or consolidating the pages into one. Also, try to minimize repeating long segments of text in different pages of your site, for example, instead of including lengthy copyright text on the bottom of every page, include a very brief summary and then link to a page with more details. You can use the Parameter Handling tool to specify how you would like Google to treat URL parameters.

For more tips, review our guide on how to avoid creating duplicate content.

Build a good user experience with navigational elements
Providing original content is only one component of creating a high-quality site. Your content should also be informative and organized in a manner that's easy for users to navigate. Consider the arrangement of the elements (text, images, etc.) on your pages. Your layout should look inviting and visitors should be able to easily find what they're looking for.



For subtitles in your language, turn on YouTube captions. Select the settings icon Image of YouTube settings icon at the bottom of the video player, then select "Subtitles/CC" and choose your language.

 

An accessible, easy-to-use navigation bar (or menu bar) is a key part of providing a good user experience. When building your navigation bar, consider the following points:

Alignment - Are all the navigational elements lined up correctly across all devices?
Readability - Is the text content on your site easy to read?
Functionality - Do your drop-down lists work correctly? Are all navigational elements clickable?
Accuracy - Are the elements bringing the user to the right content?
After you've added unique content to your site, don’t forget to organize it. We recommend that you structure and organize your content as follows:

Add navigational elements to the menu bar and organize your content by topic, category, etc. This will help users to better understand and navigate your site.
Avoid repeating the same content in multiple categories or pages of your site or creating multiple pages or sites with content taken from other sources.
Make sure that your site provides the information and service promised and does not have links that lead to:
False claims of downloadable or streaming content
Missing pages
Irrelevant or misleading pages
Text on a page not related to the theme or business model of the site
Ensure that your site appears correctly in different browsers.
We recommend visiting our AdSense blog post on refining your website’s user experience in 3 steps.

Submit your site for review
Lastly, don’t forget to review the AdSense Program policies to ensure that the content on your site is compliant with our policies.

Building a high-quality site takes effort and time. When you’ve addressed the above points, submit your site for review through the Sites page in your AdSense account. The review process usually takes a few days and you’ll be notified about the review results through your AdSense account.

Manual actions report
 See if your site has any manual actions issued against it and view the site's manual action history.

If a site has a manual action, some or all of that site will not be shown in Google search results.

Open the Manual actions report

 



What is a manual action?
Google issues a manual action against a site when a human reviewer at Google has determined that pages on the site are not compliant with Google's spam policies. Most manual actions address attempts to manipulate our search index. Most issues reported here will result in pages or sites being ranked lower or omitted from search results without any visual indication to the user.

If your site is affected by a manual action, we will notify you in the Manual Actions report and in the Search Console message center.

Why do manual actions exist?

Ever since there have been search engines, there have been people dedicated to tricking their way to the top of the results page. This is bad for searchers because more relevant pages get buried under irrelevant results, and it's bad for legitimate websites because these sites become harder to find. For these reasons, we've been working since the earliest days of Google to fight spammers, helping people find the answers they're looking for, and helping legitimate websites get traffic from search.

Google is constantly working to improve search. We take a data-driven approach and employ analysts, researchers, and statisticians to evaluate search quality on a full-time basis. Changes to our algorithms undergo extensive quality evaluation before being released. More information about our algorithm.

Our algorithms are extremely good at detecting spam, and in most cases we automatically discover it and remove it from our search results. However, to protect the quality of our index, we're also willing to take manual action to remove spam from our search results.

Do I have any manual actions against my site?
You'll see a count of manual actions against your site at the top of the report. If your site has no manual actions, you'll see a green check mark and an appropriate message.

But I just bought this site!

If you recently bought a site that violated our spam policies before you owned it, fix the issues listed in this report, then let us know in your reconsideration request that you recently acquired the site and that it now no longer violates the policies.

What pages are affected?
Expand the manual action description to see a list of patterns of affected pages. This can be a subset of your site, or the entire site. Not all of the pages matching the pattern are necessarily affected.

Example:

https://example.com/real-estate/* – some or all pages under the real-estate/ directory are affected.
Affects all pages – Manual actions with this description affect the entire site.
How do I fix the problem?
To fix a manual action on your site:

Expand the manual action description panel on the report for more information.
See which pages are affected.
See the type and short description of the issue, and follow the "Learn more" link to see detailed information and steps to fix the issue. (You can find the detailed information for each action below on this page).
Fix the issue on all affected pages. Fixing the issue on just some pages will not earn you a partial return to search results. If you have multiple manual actions on your site, read about and fix all of them.
Be sure that Google can reach your pages; affected pages should not require a login, be behind a paywall, or be blocked by robots.txt or a noindex directive. You can test accessibility by using the URL Inspection tool.
When all issues listed in the report are fixed in all pages, select Request Review in this report. In your reconsideration request, describe your fixes. A good request does three things:
Explains the exact quality issue on your site.
Describes the steps you've taken to fix the issue.
Documents the outcome of your efforts.
Reconsideration reviews can take some time (see below). You will be informed of progress by email. You will get a review confirmation message when you send your request, to inform you that the review is in progress; don't resubmit your request before you get a final decision on your outstanding request.


How long will my reconsideration review take?
Most reconsideration reviews can take several days or weeks, although in some cases, such as link-related reconsideration requests, it may take longer than usual to review your request. You will be informed by email when we receive your request, so you'll know it is active. You will also receive an email when the review is complete. Please don't resubmit your request before you get a decision on any outstanding requests.

List of manual actions
Here are the manual actions that can be applied by Google and how to fix them.

Site abused with third-party spam
User-generated spam
Spammy free host
Structured data issue
Unnatural links to your site
Unnatural links from your site
Thin content with little or no added value
Google has detected low-quality pages or shallow pages on your site. Here are a few common examples of pages that often have thin content with little or no added value:

Thin affiliate pages
Content from other sources. For example: scraped content or low-quality guest blog posts
Doorways
These techniques don't provide users with substantially unique or valuable content, and are in violation of our spam policies.



Recommended actions
First, review the following sections of our spam policies:

Thin affiliate pages
Scraped content
Doorways
Next, follow the steps below to identify and correct the violation(s) on your site:

Check for content on your site that duplicates content found elsewhere.
Check for thin content pages with affiliate links on your site.
Check for doorway pages on your site.
If your site contains any of these types of content, think about whether your site provides significant added value for your users. 
Tip: Consider asking friends or family — real people not affiliated with your site — to use or critique your site to get ideas for improving it.
Improve your website so that it provides significant value for your users.
When you're sure that your site is no longer in violation of our spam policies, select Request Review on the Manual Actions report. Provide examples of bad content that you removed and good content that you added.
After you've submitted a reconsideration request, be patient and watch for review status messages in your Search Console account — we'll let you know when we've reviewed your site. If we determine that your site is no longer in violation of our spam policies, we'll revoke the manual action.
Cloaking and/or sneaky redirects
Major spam problems
Cloaked images
Hidden text and/or keyword stuffing
AMP content mismatch
Sneaky mobile redirects
News and Discover policy violations
Site reputation abuse
What's the difference between the Manual Actions report and the Security Issues report?
There is some conceptual overlap between the Manual Actions report and the Security Issues report, so it is useful to know the difference between them:

The Manual Actions report lists manually detected issues with a page or site that are mostly attempts to manipulate our search index, but are not necessarily dangerous for users. Most issues reported here will result in pages or site being ranked lower or omitted from search results without any visual indication to the user.

The Security Issues report lists indications that your site was hacked, or behavior on your site that could potentially harm a visitor or their computer: for example, phishing attacks or installing malware or unwanted software on the user's computer. These pages can appear with a warning label in search results, or a browser can display an interstitial warning page when a user tries to visit them.

These policies apply to all web search results, including those from Google's own properties.

We detect policy-violating practices both through automated systems and, as needed, human review that can result in a manual action. Sites that violate our policies may rank lower in results or not appear in results at all.

If you believe that a site is violating Google's spam policies, let us know by filing a search quality user report. We're focused on developing scalable and automated solutions to problems, and we'll use these reports to further improve our spam detection systems.

Our policies cover common spam practices, but Google may act against any type of spam practices we detect.

Cloaking
Cloaking refers to the practice of presenting different content to users and search engines with the intent to manipulate search rankings and mislead users. Examples of cloaking include:

Showing a page about travel destinations to search engines while showing a page about discount drugs to users
Inserting text or keywords into a page only when the user agent that is requesting the page is a search engine, not a human visitor
If your site uses technologies that search engines have difficulty accessing, like JavaScript or images, see our recommendations for making that content accessible to search engines and users without cloaking.

If a site is hacked, it's not uncommon for the hacker to use cloaking to make the hack harder for the site owner to detect. Read more about fixing hacked sites and avoiding being hacked.

If you operate a paywall or a content-gating mechanism, we don't consider this to be cloaking if Google can see the full content of what's behind the paywall just like any person who has access to the gated material and if you follow our Flexible Sampling general guidance.

Doorway abuse
Doorway abuse is when sites or pages are created to rank for specific, similar search queries. They lead users to intermediate pages that are not as useful as the final destination. Examples of doorway abuse include:

Having multiple websites with slight variations to the URL and home page to maximize their reach for any specific query
Having multiple domain names or pages targeted at specific regions or cities that funnel users to one page
Generating pages to funnel visitors into the actual usable or relevant portion of a site
Creating substantially similar pages that are closer to search results than a clearly defined, browseable hierarchy
Expired domain abuse
Expired domain abuse is where an expired domain name is purchased and repurposed primarily to manipulate search rankings by hosting content that provides little to no value to users. Illustrative examples include, but are not limited to:

Affiliate content on a site previously used by a government agency
Commercial medical products being sold on a site previously used by a non-profit medical charity
Casino-related content on a former elementary school site
Hacked content
Hacked content is any content placed on a site without permission, due to vulnerabilities in a site's security. Hacked content gives poor search results to our users and can potentially install malicious content on their machines. Examples of hacking include:

Code injection: When hackers gain access to your website, they might try to inject malicious code into existing pages on your site. This often takes the form of malicious JavaScript injected directly into the site, or into iframes.
Page injection: Sometimes, due to security flaws, hackers are able to add new pages to your site that contain spammy or malicious content. These pages are often meant to manipulate search engines or to attempt phishing. Your existing pages might not show signs of hacking, but these newly-created pages could harm your site's visitors or your site's performance in search results.
Content injection: Hackers might also try to subtly manipulate existing pages on your site. Their goal is to add content to your site that search engines can see but which may be harder for you and your users to spot. This can involve adding hidden links or hidden text to a page by using CSS or HTML, or it can involve more complex changes like cloaking.
Redirects: Hackers might inject malicious code to your website that redirects some users to harmful or spammy pages. The kind of redirect sometimes depends on the referrer, user agent, or device. For example, clicking a URL in Google Search results could redirect you to a suspicious page, but there is no redirect when you visit the same URL directly from a browser.
Here are our tips on fixing hacked sites and avoiding being hacked.

Hidden text and link abuse
Hidden text or link abuse is the practice of placing content on a page in a way solely to manipulate search engines and not to be easily viewable by human visitors. Examples of hidden text or link abuse include:

Using white text on a white background
Hiding text behind an image
Using CSS to position text off-screen
Setting the font size or opacity to 0
Hiding a link by only linking one small character (for example, a hyphen in the middle of a paragraph)
There are many web design elements today that utilize showing and hiding content in a dynamic way to improve user experience; these elements don't violate our policies:

Accordion or tabbed content that toggle between hiding and showing additional content
Slideshow or slider that cycles between several images or text paragraphs
Tooltip or similar text that displays additional content when users interact with over an element
Text that's only accessible to screen readers and is intended to improve the experience for those using screen readers
Keyword stuffing
Keyword stuffing refers to the practice of filling a web page with keywords or numbers in an attempt to manipulate rankings in Google Search results. Often these keywords appear in a list or group, unnaturally, or out of context. Examples of keyword stuffing include:

Lists of phone numbers without substantial added value
Blocks of text that list cities and regions that a web page is trying to rank for
Repeating the same words or phrases so often that it sounds unnatural. For example:
Unlimited app store credit. There are so many sites that claim to offer app store credit for $0 but they're all fake and always mess up with users looking for unlimited app store credits. You can get limitless credits for app store right here on this website. Visit our unlimited app store credit page and get it today!
Link spam
Link spam is the practice of creating links to or from a site primarily for the purpose of manipulating search rankings. The following are examples of link spam:

Buying or selling links for ranking purposes. This includes:
Exchanging money for links, or posts that contain links
Exchanging goods or services for links
Sending someone a product in exchange for them writing about it and including a link
Excessive link exchanges ("Link to me and I'll link to you") or partner pages exclusively for the sake of cross-linking
Using automated programs or services to create links to your site
Requiring a link as part of a Terms of Service, contract, or similar arrangement without allowing a third-party content owner the choice of qualifying the outbound link
Text advertisements or text links that don't block ranking credit
Advertorials or native advertising where payment is received for articles that include links that pass ranking credit, or links with optimized anchor text in articles, guest posts, or press releases distributed on other sites. For example:
There are many wedding rings on the market. If you want to have a wedding, you will have to pick the best ring. You will also need to buy flowers and a wedding dress.
Low-quality directory or bookmark site links
Keyword-rich, hidden, or low-quality links embedded in widgets that are distributed across various sites
Widely distributed links in the footers or templates of various sites
Forum comments with optimized links in the post or signature, for example:
Thanks, that's great info!
- Paul
paul's pizza san diego pizza best pizza san diego
Creating low-value content primarily for the purposes of manipulating linking and ranking signals
Google does understand that buying and selling links is a normal part of the economy of the web for advertising and sponsorship purposes. It's not a violation of our policies to have such links as long as they are qualified with a rel="nofollow" or rel="sponsored" attribute value to the <a> tag.

Machine-generated traffic
Machine-generated traffic (also called automated traffic) refers to the practice of sending automated queries to Google. This includes scraping results for rank-checking purposes or other types of automated access to Google Search conducted without express permission. Machine-generated traffic consumes resources and interferes with our ability to best serve users. Such activities violate our spam policies and the Google Terms of Service.

Malware and malicious practices
Google checks to see whether websites host malware or unwanted software that negatively affects the user experience.

Malware is any software or mobile application specifically designed to harm a computer, a mobile device, the software it's running, or its users. Malware exhibits malicious behavior that can include installing software without user consent and installing harmful software such as viruses. Site owners sometimes don't realize that their downloadable files are considered malware, so these binaries might be hosted inadvertently.

Unwanted software is an executable file or mobile application that engages in behavior that is deceptive, unexpected, or that negatively affects the user's browsing or computing experience. Examples include software that switches your home page or other browser settings to ones you don't want, or apps that leak private and personal information without proper disclosure.

Site owners should make sure they don't violate the Unwanted Software Policy and follow our guidelines.

Misleading functionality 
Misleading functionality refers to the practice of intentionally creating sites that trick users into thinking they would be able to access some content or services but in reality can't. Examples of misleading functionality include:

A site with a fake generator that claims to provide app store credit but doesn't actually provide the credit
A site that claims to provide certain functionality (for example, PDF merge, countdown timer, online dictionary service), but intentionally leads users to deceptive ads rather than providing the claimed services
Scaled content abuse
Scaled content abuse is when many pages are generated for the primary purpose of manipulating search rankings and not helping users. This abusive practice is typically focused on creating large amounts of unoriginal content that provides little to no value to users, no matter how it's created.

Examples of scaled content abuse include, but are not limited to:

Using generative AI tools or other similar tools to generate many pages without adding value for users
Scraping feeds, search results, or other content to generate many pages (including through automated transformations like synonymizing, translating, or other obfuscation techniques), where little value is provided to users
Stitching or combining content from different web pages without adding value
Creating multiple sites with the intent of hiding the scaled nature of the content
Creating many pages where the content makes little or no sense to a reader but contains search keywords
If you're hosting such content on your site, exclude it from Search.

Scraping
Scraping refers to the practice of taking content from other sites, often through automated means, and hosting it with the purpose of manipulating search rankings. Examples of abusive scraping include:

Republishing content from other sites without adding any original content or value, or even citing the original source
Copying content from other sites, modify it only slightly (for example, by substituting synonyms or using automated techniques), and republish it
Reproducing content feeds from other sites without providing some type of unique benefit to the user
Creating sites dedicated to embedding or compiling content, such as videos, images, or other media from other sites, without substantial added value to the user
Site reputation abuse
Site reputation abuse is a tactic where third-party content is published on a host site mainly because of that host's already-established ranking signals, which it has earned primarily from its first-party content. The goal of this tactic is for the content to rank better than it could otherwise on its own.

Third-party content is content that's created by an entity that's separate from the established host site. Examples of separate entities include users of that site, freelancers, white-label services, and content created by people not employed directly by the host site.
Having third-party content alone isn't a violation of the site reputation abuse policy; it's only a violation if the third-party content is published on a host site mainly because of that host site's already-established ranking signals. Examples of site reputation abuse include, but are not limited to:

An educational site hosting a page about sponsored reviews of payday loans written by a third-party that distributes the same page to other sites across the web
A medical site hosting a third-party advertising page about "best casinos" that readers wouldn't expect and that's being placed on the site to rank better due to the established site's ranking signals
A movie review site hosting third-party pages about topics that would be confusing to users to find on a movie review site (such as "ways to buy followers on social media sites", the "best fortune teller sites", and the "best essay writing services")
A news site hosting coupons provided by a third-party white-label service where the main reason for publishing the coupons on the news site is to capitalize on the news site's reputation
An established first party site branches out into a new area primarily using freelance content because this content will rank better on the first-party site than it would have otherwise
If you're hosting pages that violate this policy, learn how to correct this issue.

Examples that are NOT considered site reputation abuse include:

Wire service or press release service sites
News publications that have syndicated news content from other news publications
Sites designed to allow user-generated content, such as a forum website or comment sections
Columns, opinion pieces, articles, and other work of an editorial nature
Third-party content (for example, "advertorial" or "native advertising" type pages) where the purpose is to share content directly to readers (such as through promotion within the publication itself), rather than hosting the content to manipulate search rankings
Using affiliate links throughout a page, with links treated appropriately, or embedding third-party ad units throughout a page
Coupons that are sourced directly from merchants and other businesses that serve consumers
Sneaky redirects
Redirecting is the act of sending a visitor to a different URL than the one they initially requested. Sneaky redirecting is the practice of doing this maliciously in order to either show users and search engines different content or show users unexpected content that does not fulfill their original needs. Examples of sneaky redirects include:

Showing search engines one type of content while redirecting users to something significantly different
Showing desktop users a normal page while redirecting mobile users to a completely different spam domain
While sneaky redirection is a type of spam, there are many legitimate, non-spam reasons to redirect one URL to another. Examples of legitimate redirects include:

Moving your site to a new address
Consolidating several pages into one
Redirecting users to an internal page once they are logged in
When examining if a redirect is sneaky, consider whether or not the redirect is intended to deceive either the users or search engines. Learn more about how to appropriately employ redirects on your site.

Thin affiliation
Thin affiliation is the practice of publishing content with product affiliate links where the product descriptions and reviews are copied directly from the original merchant without any original content or added value.

Affiliate pages can be considered thin if they are a part of a program that distributes its content across a network of affiliates without providing additional value. These sites often appear to be cookie-cutter sites or templates with the same or similar content replicated within the same site or across multiple domains or languages. If a Search results page returned several of these sites, all with the same content, thin affiliate pages would create a frustrating user experience.

Not every site that participates in an affiliate program is a thin affiliate. Good affiliate sites add value by offering meaningful content or features. Examples of good affiliate pages include offering additional information about price, original product reviews, rigorous testing and ratings, navigation of products or categories, and product comparisons.

User-generated spam
User-generated spam is spammy content added to a site by users through a channel intended for user content. Often site owners are unaware of the spammy content. Examples of spammy user-generated content include:

Spammy accounts on hosting services that anyone can register for
Spammy posts on forum threads
Comment spam on blogs
Spammy files uploaded to file hosting platforms
Here are several tips on how to prevent abuse of your site's public areas. Here are our tips on fixing hacked sites and avoiding being hacked.

Other practices that can lead to demotion or removal
Legal removals
When we receive a significant volume of valid copyright removal requests involving a given site, we are able to use that to demote other content from the site in our results. This way, if there is other infringing content, people are less likely to encounter it versus the original content. We apply similar demotion signals to complaints involving defamation, counterfeit goods, and court-ordered removals. In the case of child sexual abuse material (CSAM), we always remove such content when it is identified and we demote all content from sites with a significant proportion of CSAM content.

Personal information removals
If we process a significant volume of personal information removals involving a site with exploitative removal practices, we demote other content from the site in our results. We also look to see if the same pattern of behavior is happening with other sites and, if so, apply demotions to content on those sites. We may apply similar demotion practices for sites that receive a significant volume of removals of content involving doxxing content, explicit personal imagery created or shared without consent, or explicit non-consensual fake content.

Policy circumvention
If a site continues to engage in actions intended to bypass our spam policies or content policies for Google Search, we may take appropriate action which may include restricting or removing eligibility for some of our search features (for example, Top Stories, Discover) and taking broader action in Google Search (for example, removing more sections of a site from Search results). Circumvention includes but is not limited to:

Using existing or creating new subdomains, subdirectories, or sites with the intention of continuing to violate our policies
Using other methods intended to continue distributing content or engaging in a behavior that aims to violate our policies
Scam and fraud
Scam and fraud come in many forms, including but not limited to impersonating an official business or service through imposter sites, intentionally displaying false information about a business or service, or otherwise attracting users to a site on false pretenses. Using automated systems, Google seeks to identify pages with scammy or fraudulent content and prevent them from showing up in Google Search results. Examples of online scams and fraud include:

Impersonating a well-known business or service provider to trick users into paying money to the wrong party
Creating deceptive sites pretending to provide official customer support on behalf of a legitimate business or provide fake contact information of such business
