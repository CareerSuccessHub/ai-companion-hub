# This will be updated with actual publisher ID after AdSense approval

# Placeholder - Google AdSense
# google.com, pub-0000000000000000, DIRECT, f08c47fec0942fa0

# Instructions:
# 1. After AdSense approves your site, they'll give you a Publisher ID (looks like pub-1234567890123456)
# 2. Replace the pub-0000000000000000 above with your actual Publisher ID
# 3. Uncomment the line (remove the # at the start)
# 4. Deploy to production

# Note: This file fixes the "ads.txt not found" error
# The "Low value content" issue requires manual blog posts or alternative monetization (Gumroad/Ko-fi)
